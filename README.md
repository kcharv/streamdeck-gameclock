# streamdeck-gameclock

Project started from a conversation with a friend who wanted a count down game clock which he could easily adjust up and down if he forgot to stop it or if the clock got adjusted by the officials.

Utilizing the barraider streamdeck tools (https://github.com/BarRaider/streamdeck-tools), this plugin was born.

Works with both dials and buttons on the streamdeck platform, although no time adjustments with buttons.
